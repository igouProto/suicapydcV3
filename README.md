# suicapydcV3
I'm forgetting Python so I'm rewriting Suica once again.

### Some notes to myself:
This rewrite (might be the last time) involves the following changes in design:
- Messages from Suica are now in Reples so no hard coding!
- Embeds should be implemented in the same way
- Music player embeds should be a separate module
- Extensions/Cogs now live in the Extensions directory
- Extensions should not be monolithic anymore
